# Non-Linear Optimization Project: Invasions and Popularity

This was the second homework for an optimization course at UC3M.

This project delves into two distinct non-linear optimization challenges, showcasing the versatility of mathematical modeling. The project is divided into two main parts:

## Part 1: Plan to Invade China

### Description:

In this section, the project engages in a hypothetical exploration of strategic planning for an invasion of China. The primary objective is to formulate and solve a non-linear optimization problem aimed at maximizing the probability of a successful invasion. Key components of this part include:

- **Formulation of Objectives:** Defining clear goals and objectives for the invasion, considering factors such as military strength, geographical considerations, and logistical efficiency.

- **Identification of Constraints:** Recognizing the limitations and constraints that impact the invasion plan, including resource constraints, geopolitical factors, and potential resistance.

- **Mathematical Model:** Developing a non-linear mathematical model that encapsulates the objectives and constraints, providing a foundation for optimization algorithms.

- **Optimization Solution:** Utilizing advanced optimization techniques to find the optimal strategy that maximizes the likelihood of success, considering the complex interplay of variables.

- **Interpretation of Results:** Analyzing and interpreting the results to extract actionable insights and strategic recommendations for the hypothetical invasion scenario.

This part serves as only an illustrative example and how optimization can offer valuable insights into strategic planning processes.

## Part 2: Football Teams Popularity

### Description:

In the second segment of this project, the focus shifts towards a non-linear optimization problem related to the popularity of football teams. The primary objective is to develop a model that maximizes the popularity of football teams based on various factors. Key components of this part include:

- **Defining Popularity Metrics:** Establishing quantifiable metrics for team popularity, considering factors such as goals scored, budget, sponsorship deals, trophies won, and the presence of corruption cases.

- **Formulation of the Optimization Problem:** Constructing a non-linear mathematical model that captures the relationship between different variables and team popularity, accounting for both positive and negative influences.

- **Solver Implementation:** Utilizing optimization solvers, such as IPOPT, to find the optimal values for the variables that result in the maximum team popularity.

- **Interpreting Results:** Analyzing the results to understand the impact of each variable on team popularity, providing valuable insights for football clubs seeking to enhance their fan base.

- **Real-world Application:** Applying the developed model to real-world football teams, showcasing how the optimization process can offer strategic guidance for teams looking to improve their overall popularity.

This part demonstrates the versatility of non-linear optimization in addressing diverse problems, from military strategy to sports management, highlighting its applicability across various domains.
